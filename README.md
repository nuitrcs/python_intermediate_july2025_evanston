   2. Open the Anaconda Navigator app. Select *JupyterLab* to launch Jupyter Lab. Within lab, navigate to the downloaded workshop folder and open `.ipynb` file corresponding to the bootcamp day. For example, for the 2nd day, you will open `part2.ipynb`.

2. **If you are working from Colab**
   1. Open the notebook on Google Colab my clicking on a link below corresponding to the notebook.

**NOTE ON THE COLAB OPTION**: Progress is NOT automatically saved on your Drive or your computer. To save the file, navigate to `File > Save a Copy in Drive`. Once you do, a new tab will appear with the copy. You can save the progress throughout the workshop by `ctrl + s` (if you're on Windows) or `cmd + s` (if you're on macOS).
