    "Let's create a Python script that analyzes a list of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Write a script that:\n",
    "- Reads in a file which will contain a list of words, expecting one word per line.\n",
    "- Prints out the list of words as part of a complete sentence.\n",
    "- Finds and prints:\n",
    "  1. The longest word\n",
    "  2. The number of words that start with a vowel\n",
    "  3. A list of all words in uppercase, printed one word per line.\n",
    "- Each of the printed outputs should be written as a complete sentence.\n",
    "- *BONUS*: Rather than printing all words in uppercase (task 3 above), add a user-defined argument for the number of words to print (e.g., if the user supplies 2, you only print the first 2 words in your list). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file called `word_analysis.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In this file:\n",
    "   - Define **at least one function** that returns the outputs listed above.\n",
    "   - use the `argparse` module to get the filename (and any other arguments you need) from the user.\n",
    "   - Use `print()` statements in the `__main__` section to display results when the script is run directly.\n",
    "   - Add **helpful comments** and **docstrings** to tell users about your script, what each function does and what inputs are required, and how to run your script.\n",
    "   - Include the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` section so that your script outputs the results when the user runs it from the command line.\n",
    "3. Run your script from the **command line** to apply your function(s) to the file `words.txt` .\n",
    "4. Run your script from a **notebook** to apply your function(s) to the file `words.txt` .\n"
